<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiofrequency (RF) Ablation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Irrigated</li><li>Non-irrigated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The RF ablation catheters market is categorized into two main types: irrigated and non-irrigated catheters. Irrigated catheters deliver a continuous flow of saline to the electrode tip, allowing for better temperature control and minimizing tissue damage during ablation. This technology is often preferred for complex procedures requiring precision. Non-irrigated catheters, on the other hand, rely on direct contact to deliver energy, making them simpler and more cost-effective but potentially riskier in terms of overheating and collateral damage to surrounding tissues.</p></p>
