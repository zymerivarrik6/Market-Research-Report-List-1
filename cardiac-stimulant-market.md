<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Stimulant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cardiac Glycosides</li><li>Non-Cardiac Glycosides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac stimulant market is primarily divided into two types: cardiac glycosides and non-cardiac glycosides. Cardiac glycosides, derived from plant sources like the foxglove plant, enhance cardiac contractility and are commonly used in treating heart failure and arrhythmias. Non-cardiac glycosides, on the other hand, include a broader category of agents that stimulate the heart through different mechanisms, often with fewer side effects. Both types play a critical role in managing cardiovascular conditions, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.</p></p>
