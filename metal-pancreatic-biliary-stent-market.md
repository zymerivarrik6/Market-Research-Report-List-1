<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Pancreatic & Biliary Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Metal Stent</li><li>Uncovered Metal Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Metal Pancreatic & Biliary Stent market comprises two primary types: covered metal stents and uncovered metal stents. Covered metal stents are designed with a layer of material that prevents tissue ingrowth, reducing the risk of blockage and maintaining patency longer. In contrast, uncovered metal stents lack this layer, allowing for tissue integration, which can enhance anchoring but may lead to increased risk of obstruction over time. Both types are utilized to manage obstructions in the pancreatic and biliary ducts, offering distinct advantages based on clinical needs.</p></p>
